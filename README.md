This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to take turns playing on a 3x3 grid, trying to get three marks (either "X" or "O") in a row, column, or diagonal. The app tracks the game state and displays the winner or a draw when the game concludes.

Features:
Two-player Mode: Players alternate turns, placing their respective marks ("X" or "O") on the grid.
Game Reset: The game automatically resets after a win or draw, allowing players to start a new game.
Winning Logic: The app checks all possible winning combinations (rows, columns, diagonals) and announces the winner.
Draw Detection: If all the grid spaces are filled and no player wins, the game detects a draw.
Responsive Design: The game layout adjusts for different screen sizes, making it playable on both desktops and mobile devices.
Technologies Used:
HTML: Structures the game board and user interface.
CSS: Styles the grid and ensures the game is visually appealing and responsive.
JavaScript: Implements the game logic, handling player turns, checking for a winner, and resetting the game.
